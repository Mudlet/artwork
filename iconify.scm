;Description...: Iconify plug-in converts a single layer of a single image into a multi-layered image ready to be saved as a Windows icon.
;The new image will contain all standard sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) at all standard bit depths (16 colors, 256 colors, 32-bit RGBA), with transparency support.
;The new image will also contain a big version (256x256 32-bit RGBA)

; These two functions allow us to create new layers which are
; clones of the existing ones but at different color depths.
; We have to use two functions and pass through intermediate
; images because otherwise the second color reduction would dupe
; the layers, thus giving an unneeded extra set of layers
; TODO a potential study should be done on whether it's better
; to go straight to the lowest number of color (as we do), or
; passing through intermediate number of colors.
; Observe that no dithering is done. This is intentional, since
; it gives the best results.
